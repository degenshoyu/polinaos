# 📘 PolinaOS: Building Autonomous Communities with AI

## 1. Introduction

**Web3 teams ship faster than ever — but community coordination is still stuck in the past.**

As AI advances, a new wave of small, fast-moving teams is launching meme coins, DAOs, and tokenized side projects at record speed. From [pump.fun](https://pump.fun) to [letsbonk.fun](https://letsbonk.fun) to Believe, a new era of permissionless community creation is here. But most teams still rely on spreadsheets, Google forms, and Discord chaos to manage contributors and distribute rewards.

**PolinaOS fixes that.**

It’s an autonomous operating system for Web3 communities — combining **AI**, **Crypto Twitter data**, and **on-chain proof systems** like Merkle claim contracts to automate everything from:

- ✅ Mission creation
- 📊 Impact evaluation
- 🎁 Token reward distribution

No more manual work.
No more hunting down “who did what.”

**Teams can focus on building and inspiring — and let Polina handle the boring parts.**
